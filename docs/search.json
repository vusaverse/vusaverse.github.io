    "text": "VU Analytics is committed to using data to support policy making, student guidance and scientific research into academic success as effectively as possible. We call this data-informed policy. We provide the VU with insights into student intake, progression and graduation and thus contribute to the quality of education at the VU.\nVU Analytics investigates VU study data. This study data is created during the paths students take within the VU ‘garden’.\n\nPart of it is about the origin of students and what they did ‘before the gate’: their previous education in the Netherlands or abroad, how they oriented themselves at the VU, which study choices they made. This includes data from Studielink, orientation data, data from the study choice trajectory, the introduction and the language proficiency test.\nThe next part is about what they do in the garden: where the VU career of students starts, what choices students make about their routes within and between programmes, their study results and academic success. VU Analytics largely receives this data from the student administration via VUdata.\nFinally, it is about how our students fare after they leave the garden with a diploma: a follow-up study or their labour market success.\n\nAll these data are traces left behind in the garden. The team combines study data to create an enriched dataset. We use the study data in our dataset to understand our students better, to improve the quality of education, and to study student intake, progression and graduation.\nOn their path, students may come across many things that are beautiful or could be improved. Attractive places to talk to a lecturer or study advisor, interesting paths and flowers, but also fallen trees or small rivers that are difficult to cross without help. VU policy officers and programme managers turn to VU Analytics for good advice on routes to be recommended. Together, they discuss possible barriers. Under the watchful eye of the privacy officer, the team investigates relevant data and provides specific advice that can be used by colleagues and, ultimately, by students. Through all these investigations, the team gets a good picture of the entire VU, which helps with general issues for the VU as a whole. \nTo achieve this, Team VU Analytics has contact with a broad network of policy staff and members of education management. VU Analytics regularly participates in various educational consultations within the VU. We also proactively organise a sounding board group to ensure that the initiatives and services of VU Analytics are as closely aligned as possible with the wishes and needs of the organisation. The sounding board group consists of representatives from the various bodies and target groups.\nWe can be reached for questions about data for educational policy or scientific research at: VU-analytics@vu.nl."
