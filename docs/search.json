    "text": "In the world of data science, developing and sharing R packages is a crucial aspect of collaborative work. However, ensuring reproducibility, managing dependencies, and maintaining a consistent development environment can be challenging. This is where Docker Rocker comes in. In this blog post, we will explore the pros and cons of using Docker Rocker for R package development and provide a step-by-step guide to help you get started.\n\n\n\nReproducibility: Docker allows you to create a containerized environment that encapsulates all the dependencies required for your R package. This ensures that your code will run consistently across different systems, making it easier to reproduce your work.\nIsolation: Docker containers provide a sandboxed environment, allowing you to isolate your R package development from other dependencies or configurations on your system. This helps prevent conflicts and ensures that your package development environment remains stable.\nPortability: Docker containers can be easily shared and deployed across different platforms and systems, making it convenient for collaboration and deployment.\nVersion Control: With Docker, you can version control your containerized environment, including the specific versions of R, packages, and system dependencies. This makes it easier to track changes and roll back to previous versions if needed.\nFlexibility: Docker Rocker provides a wide range of pre-built containers for different versions of R, allowing you to easily switch between R versions for testing and development purposes.\n\n\n\n\nCons of Using Docker Rocker for R Package Development:\n\nLearning Curve: Docker has its own set of commands and concepts that may require some learning and adjustment if you are new to it.\nIncreased Complexity: Docker adds an additional layer of complexity to your development workflow, as you need to manage and maintain the Docker images and containers alongside your R package code.\nResource Overhead: Running R packages within Docker containers may consume more system resources compared to running them directly on the host system. This can impact the performance and responsiveness of your development environment.\nBuild Time: Building Docker images can take some time, especially when installing and configuring dependencies. However, this build time is a one-time cost, and subsequent container launches are faster."

    "text": "VU Analytics is a VU data facility that analyses education and student data in order to improve student intake, progression and graduation in all phases of education.\nVU Analytics is committed to using data to support policy making, student guidance and scientific research into academic success as effectively as possible. We call this data-informed policy. We provide the VU with insights into student intake, progression and graduation and thus contribute to the quality of education at the VU.\nVU Analytics investigates VU study data. This study data is created during the paths students take within the VU ‘garden’.\n\nPart of it is about the origin of students and what they did ‘before the gate’: their previous education in the Netherlands or abroad, how they oriented themselves at the VU, which study choices they made. This includes data from Studielink, orientation data, data from the study choice trajectory, the introduction and the language proficiency test.\nThe next part is about what they do in the garden: where the VU career of students starts, what choices students make about their routes within and between programmes, their study results and academic success. VU Analytics largely receives this data from the student administration via VUdata.\nFinally, it is about how our students fare after they leave the garden with a diploma: a follow-up study or their labour market success.\n\nAll these data are traces left behind in the garden. The team combines study data to create an enriched dataset. We use the study data in our dataset to understand our students better, to improve the quality of education, and to study student intake, progression and graduation.\nOn their path, students may come across many things that are beautiful or could be improved. Attractive places to talk to a lecturer or study advisor, interesting paths and flowers, but also fallen trees or small rivers that are difficult to cross without help. VU policy officers and programme managers turn to VU Analytics for good advice on routes to be recommended. Together, they discuss possible barriers. Under the watchful eye of the privacy officer, the team investigates relevant data and provides specific advice that can be used by colleagues and, ultimately, by students. Through all these investigations, the team gets a good picture of the entire VU, which helps with general issues for the VU as a whole. \nTo achieve this, Team VU Analytics has contact with a broad network of policy staff and members of education management. VU Analytics regularly participates in various educational consultations within the VU. We also proactively organise a sounding board group to ensure that the initiatives and services of VU Analytics are as closely aligned as possible with the wishes and needs of the organisation. The sounding board group consists of representatives from the various bodies and target groups.\nWe can be reached for questions about data for educational policy or scientific research at: VU-analytics@vu.nl."
