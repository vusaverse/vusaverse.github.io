# Announcing Tableau Cloud Support

[![vvtableau](/assets/hex-vvtableau.png)](https://vusaverse.github.io/vvtableau/)

In our latest update, we're excited to announce that `vvtableau` now supports Tableau Cloud, expanding its capabilities beyond Tableau Server to include the cloud-based platform. This significant enhancement allows users to automate tasks across both Tableau Server and Tableau Cloud, providing a unified interface for managing Tableau resources.

## What's New in vvtableau 0.6.0?

The `vvtableau` 0.6.0 release brings several key updates that significantly enhance its functionality and usability:

-   **Extract Refresh Task Execution**: A new function has been added to run extract refresh tasks immediately on the server. This feature is particularly useful for ensuring that your data is always up-to-date without manual intervention.

-   **Data Source and Workbook Updates**: Functions to update a data source and a workbook on the server have been introduced. These updates allow for dynamic changes to data sources and workbooks, enabling more flexible and responsive data management workflows.

-   **Enhanced User and Group Management**: With the addition of Users and Groups Tableau REST API methods in `vvtableau` 0.4.0, the package now offers a more comprehensive set of tools for managing users and groups on Tableau Server and Cloud.

### Getting Started with the Updated vvtableau

To take advantage of these new features, you'll need to update your vvtableau package. Here's how you can do it:

``` r

## Install the package from CRAN

install.packages("vvtableau")

## Or install the development version from GitHub

devtools::install_github("vusaverse/vvtableau")

## Load package

library(vvtableau)

## Authenticate on the Tableau Server using password

tableau <- authenticate_server(
  username = tableau_username(),
  password = tableau_password(),
  base_url = tableau_base_url(),
  api_version = 3.4
)

## Authenticate on the Tableau Server or Tableau Cloud using Personal Access Token (PAT)

tableau <- authenticate_PAT(
  pat_name = tableau_pat_name(),
  pat_secret = tableau_pat_secret(),
  content_url = tableau_content_url(),
  base_url = tableau_base_url(),
  api_version = 3.4
)

## The above "tableau" object can now be passed in every Tableau REST API method.
## Example: get all users

users <- get_server_users(
  tableau,
  api_version = 3.4,
  page_number = 1,
  page_size = 100,
  include_metadata = FALSE
)
```

Please refer to the function documentation on what values to pass for the argument when using either Tableau Server or Tableau Cloud.
