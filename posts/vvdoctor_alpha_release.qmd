# Announcing the Launch of vvdoctor: A Shiny App for Effortless Data Analysis

[![vvdoctor](/assets/hex-vvdoctor.png)](https://edulytics.shinyapps.io/vvdoctor/)

We are excited to announce the launch of `vvdoctor`, a new R Shiny app (and package) that provides a user-friendly interface for statistical testing from data! The goal is to aid to data-driven decision making from a statistical perspective. When is a difference large enough? Is there a notable increase from last year? Is there a difference between group A and B? These questions can be difficult to answer from solely a data-analytical perspective. `vvdoctor` alleviates this difficulty by easily allowing researchers, data analysts, and anyone interested in exploring data to easily conduct statistical tests from data! Upload your file,  visualize your data, and perform a wide range of statistical tests in `vvdoctor`. 

`vvdoctor` is now live and is accessible at: [shinyapps.io](https://edulytics.shinyapps.io/vvdoctor/). This app is the result of a collaborative effort by the team at Vusaverse, and it aims to simplify the process of conducting statistical tests from data.

## Key Features

- Seamless Data Uploading: With just a few clicks, you can upload your data files in various formats, including CSV, RDS, Parquet, and more. The app will automatically display the data in a dataframe.

- Data Visualization: Generating histograms and other visualizations is a breeze. Simply select the variable you want to explore, and the app will generate the corresponding plot.

- Comprehensive Statistical Testing: `vvdoctor` offers a wide range of statistical tests, including t-tests, ANOVA, correlations, and more. The app will guide you through the process of selecting the appropriate test based on the characteristics of your data.

- Interpretable Results: Once you've run a statistical test, the app will display the test statistic, p-value, and any other relevant information, making it easy to interpret the results.

Please refer to the `vvdoctor` [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vusaverse/vvdoctor) of the project for further specification. 

## Getting Started

To start using vvdoctor, simply visit the app at [shinyapps.io](https://edulytics.shinyapps.io/vvdoctor/). Alternatively, you can install the package directly in R and run the app locally:

## Contributing and Feedback
This release of  `vvdoctor` is an alpha-version. There are many improvements being made currently and many improvements to be made! We aim to polish up `vvdoctor` with the help of the R community! We're committed to continuously improving `vvdoctor` and adding new features to make data analysis even more accessible. If you have any suggestions, ideas, or encounter any issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
